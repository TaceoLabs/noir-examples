# Noir Examples

This repository holds a collection of few examples using our implementations of cryptographic primitives in Noir.

## Size Tracking

In the `tools/` directory, there is a `justfile` that collects the circuit sizes of the examples and writes it into a MarkDown file. This is useful to track changes over different versions of the packages or the Noir compiler.
